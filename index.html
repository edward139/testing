    <h3> What is CSS Spacing?</h3>
    
        <p>CSS spacing is an essential feature that helps you arrange and organize every other element of your web application in a neat and sensible manner. This helps improve web accessibility and creates a better user experience.
        To go more in-depth, CSS spacing refers to how you insert space within and between CSS elements on a web page. It plays a very important role in web design and is used to enhance readability, usability, and the overall aesthetic of a webpage.
        Spacing consists of various parts, which include padding, margins, and borders. Each of these contributes to the spatial relationship between elements.</p>
